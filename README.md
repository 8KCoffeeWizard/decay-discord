Makes Discord comfortable for any type of users, the cavemans and those that love going out and enjoy the sun!

## Setup

`git clone https://github.com/decaycs/decay-discord.git`

To be able to use the Decay Discord Theme, you need to have one of the "projects" below:

| Project | Source |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| BetterDisocrd | [BD](https://betterdiscord.app/) |
| PowerCord | [PC](https://powercord.dev/) |

After you setup your prefered "project", all you have to do is:
`cp /path/to/decay-discord/Decay.theme.css /path/to/projects/themes_directory`

## Origin
This theme was inspired and is based on [MinimalCord](https://github.com/DiscordStyles/MinimalCord/) but a modified version of it, to match the needs of an eye at peace and match the Decay structure.
