Makes Discord Comfortable for any type of users, darkness lovers and those that love going out and enjoy the sun.

## Origin
This theme was inspired by [MinimalCord](https://github.com/DiscordStyles/MinimalCord/).

## Setup
To be able to use the Decay Discord Theme, you need to either have [BetterDisocrd](https://betterdiscord.app) or some Discord plugin that can read and compile custom CSS.

Just download the CSS file and move it to the themes folder (if using BD) or at the required location for any kind of plugin you use.
